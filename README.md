# Angular Todo App

## Description

This is a basic todo app built in Agular 12.2.3 as part of a "coding challenge" within a few hours. The commit history was unfortunately lost when moving it from one repo to another.

## Install

Make sure to install everything first, e.g. by using npm install.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.



## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Cypress was used for a few e2e tests.

## Further help
